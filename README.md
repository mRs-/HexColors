HexColors
=========================

With this category it is easy to handle HEX and RGB Colors within the UIColor and NSColor class (iOS and OSX).

Example
-------
``` objective-c
UIColor *colorWithHex = [UIColor colorWithHexString:@"#ff8942" alpha:1];
```

It's really easy. Instead of recalculating HEX colors to RGB use this little category like a boss!

Installation
-------
* `#import HexColors.h` where you want to use the HEX Categories
* `pod install HexColors`
* or just drag the source files in your project
